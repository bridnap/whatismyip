# What Is My IP

Built because I needed a simple IP address identifier from a site that would not be blocked by my company's firewall administrators.  One can of course just use Google search and that'll get you the right information most of the time.  However, for dual verification, this works well.

[Demo](http://bridnap.github.io/whatismyip) - Will show your device's current outward facing IP address.

Built on the [IpIfy](http://ipify.org) API, making this tiny app extremely easy to setup.
