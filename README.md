# What Is My IP
Built because I needed a simple IP address identifier from a site that would not be blocked by my company's firewall administrators.  One can of course just use Google search and that'll get you the right information most of the time.  However, for dual verification, this works well.

Built on ipify.org API, mkaing this tiny app extremely easy to setup.
